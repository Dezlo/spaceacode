If I can get the job done in a way that other developers can follow behind me and immediately (or at least easily) understand what I’ve done, that’s what I’ll do. So, What Is Clean Code? These days it’s much more important that you and I can read the code efficiently than the device can (in most cases) . When I write code, my first objective is always to get the job done. Following that, I write code for human readability, then runtime complexity, then conciseness. Finally, if I can, I make the code easily reusable. If I must write code in such a way that it’s no longer easily human readable in order to satisfy a complexity/time or re-usability requirement, you can be sure that it will be very well documented. An Example of What I Consider Clean Code I was recently given a challenge to find a sole odd number in an array of even numbers, or vice-versa. I was given an array of Integers as the input, and I didn''t know whether or not it contained odd or even numbers. There would definitely be a minimum of 3 values in the array and only one of them would be odd/even.',
